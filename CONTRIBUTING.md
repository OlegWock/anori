# Contributing

Hey! I'm happy to see you here. This document outlines contribution guidelines for Anori. I don't want to write a huge doc which requires 30 minutes to read, that's no fun, isn't it? So I'll keep this short.

Currently, only pull requests for bug fixes and translations are accepted. If you want to add a new feature, please create an issue describing your idea first. Feature requests or proposals should not be submitted as pull requests; instead, open an issue to discuss your suggestion.

While contributions are welcome, Anori is an opinionated project. I don't try to cater to every audience by adding every feature that is requested. And because of this, I ask you to create an issue first. In case you want to add some very specific feature, there are chances it won't be accepted into the project, so I don't want you to spend time on a feature that won't get into master. You're still free to fork Anori and add your desired feature there though.
