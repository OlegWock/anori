# Installation

* If you use Chrome or any browser based on Chromium -> install extension from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/anori/ddeaekifelikgnaacipabpmjpffgifek)
* If you use Firefox -> install extension from [Firefox Browser Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/anori/)
* Anori also suports Safari, but due to bugs in webkit (namely [this](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226440), [this](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=259637) and [this](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=259656)) it's not actively supported. You can compile Safari version for yourself, but some functions won't work.
