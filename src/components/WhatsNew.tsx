                            Expandable widgets introduced in previous release (like embedded page or calculator) now
                            can be detached and moved/resized. You can open multiple windows from different widgets (but
                            only one window per widget, yet).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Previous release was a bit buggy, sorry for that (especially for disappeared widgets)! This release fixes reported/found errors from previous release.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fixed bug with incorrect widgets size/inconsistent spacing between widgets on some screen sizes.</li>

                    <h2>1.11.0</h2>
                    <p>There are a lot of changes in this release, so if you find any bugs please let me know by creating <a href="https://github.com/OlegWock/anori/issues">issue</a>!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Added new 'Embedded webpage' plugin. Now you can add your Notion Dashboard or your favorite Google Doc to Anori.
                            Or even have C̶̺͍̜̾͌͗͂͠h̸̨̛͌́̂a̷̢̝̔̈́͑͂̅͂̕t̸̡̛̫̖͔̘̺́ͅG̷̲͐́͌̍P̵̗̮̹̭͇̽̅̀͑͠T̵̖̗͓̼̖͍͑̅ (sorry!) here. Not available on Firefox (yet).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Also added new 'Math' plugin. There is currently only a calculator, but a powerful one! It uses math.js library under
                            the hood, which supports a lot
                            of <a href="https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions.html">functions</a>, <a href="https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/constants.html">constants</a> and <a href="https://mathjs.org/docs/datatypes/units.html#reference">units</a>.
                            And all this also works in command menu!
                        </li>
                        <li>Tasks, notes, RSS feed and recently closed tabs widgets now can be resized.</li>
                        <li>Now you can move widgets to another folder. Just drag them over folder you'd like to move them to and release mouse button. Poof!</li>
                        <li>Added option to monitor status (up/down) of a bookmark (you can find it on the widget configuration screen). Web developers and self-hosters, this one is for you!</li>
                        <li>
                            I decided to change how extension behaves when you resize window (or switch to smaller screen).
                            Previously, extension tried to reposition widgets which didn't fit and if that was impossible just hide them.
                            This behavior confused quite a lot of you and was also kinda prone to bugs. Now Anori just shows scrollbar in such case.

                            Settings grown to be quite lengthy for single modal, so in this version they got reorganized
                            into separate screens. And we have two new options: to hide "Edit folder" button and to
                            change page title.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I changed font used in the extension (Quicksand → Nunito). Old font doesn't support
                            Cyrillic and I plan to double down on translating the extension into other languages, so
                            it was a deal-breaker. I also tweaked styles a bit so text should be more readable now.
                            I hope you'll like new font!
                        </li>
                        <li>Added Ukrainian translation. If you would like to help translating Anori into your language, check <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/OlegWock/anori/issues/104">this</a>.</li>
                        <li>New big datetime widget!</li>

                    <p>
                        Recently, Anori got a lot of traction on tiki-toki app, and I'd like to use this opportunity to
                        welcome new users. I hope you get yourself comfortable with Anori. In this version, I addressed
                        some bugs and inconveniences you reported, now you can:
                    </p>
                    <ul className='margin-top'>
                        <li>
                            Open Anori tab by clicking on extension icon in top right
                            corner (especially useful for Opera users).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reorder tasks in ToDo widget.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Import bookmark from browser (when adding new bookmark to folder).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        I also added analytics to better understand which functions you use the most and which aren't
                        used. Analytics is opt-in, so Anori won't send any data if you don't enable analytics. And
                        even when enabled, extension doesn't send any private info. All it collect is: how much folders
                        you have, which widgets you use, which theme you use, how many custom icons you have, how often
                        you use keyboard shortcuts. Anori doesn't send name of your folder, or URL of bookmarks, or
                        content of your notes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I kindly ask you to enable this feature, as it will help me to develop better product.
                        You can always change your choice in settings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This feature uses a kinda experimental API which support only recently landed in Firefox, so if
                        you don't see 'Custom icons' section in settings, make sure you're using at least Firefox 111.
                        Chrome users should be fine as is.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Please note.</strong> To support custom icons in backups, format of backups also changed
                        (now it's zip which includes your custom icons). So if you use this feature you might
                        want to export a fresh backup.
