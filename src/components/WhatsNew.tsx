              <li>Top sites widget is now resizable.</li>
              <li>
                This is again a housekeeping release. I want to cleanup and polish existing features in Anori before
                adding any new ones.
              </li>
              <li>
                I removed some of the features: windowing system (e.g. for widgets like calculator and embedded page),
                command menu, focus stealer, option to hide edit folder button, label plugin. All of them were either
                very rarely used, or didn't feel right from product and/or design point of view.
              </li>
              <li>
                Significantly changed how icons are stored and loaded. All your existing icons should work as previosuly
                (let me know if something broke!), but now they are loaded directly from the icons service (we use{" "}

                , it's great). This allowed to significantly reduce size of the extension and provide even more icons
                than before at the same time.
              </li>

                Significant changes to analytics. As always, Anori doesn't send any analytics if you didn't enable it

                Unfortunately, I had to remove search widget from the Anori due to requirements from Google. I apologize

                Also added new 'Math' plugin. There is currently only a calculator, but a powerful one! It uses math.js

                Added option to monitor status (up/down) of a bookmark (you can find it on the widget configuration
                screen). Web developers and self-hosters, this one is for you!
              </li>
              <li>
                I decided to change how extension behaves when you resize window (or switch to smaller screen).
                Previously, extension tried to reposition widgets which didn't fit and if that was impossible just hide
                them. This behavior confused quite a lot of you and was also kinda prone to bugs. Now Anori just shows
                scrollbar in such case.

                tweaked styles a bit so text should be more readable now. I hope you'll like new font!

              Recently, Anori got a lot of traction on tiki-toki app, and I'd like to use this opportunity to welcome
              new users. I hope you get yourself comfortable with Anori. In this version, I addressed some bugs and
              inconveniences you reported, now you can:
            </p>
            <ul className="margin-top">
              <li>
                Open Anori tab by clicking on extension icon in top right corner (especially useful for Opera users).
              </li>
              <li>Reorder tasks in ToDo widget.</li>
              <li>Import bookmark from browser (when adding new bookmark to folder).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              I also added analytics to better understand which functions you use the most and which aren't used.
              Analytics is opt-in, so Anori won't send any data if you don't enable analytics. And even when enabled,
              extension doesn't send any private info. All it collect is: how much folders you have, which widgets you
              use, which theme you use, how many custom icons you have, how often you use keyboard shortcuts. Anori
              doesn't send name of your folder, or URL of bookmarks, or content of your notes.
            </p>

            <p>
              I kindly ask you to enable this feature, as it will help me to develop better product. You can always
              change your choice in settings.

              This feature uses a kinda experimental API which support only recently landed in Firefox, so if you don't
              see 'Custom icons' section in settings, make sure you're using at least Firefox 111. Chrome users should
              be fine as is.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Please note.</strong> To support custom icons in backups, format of backups also changed (now it's
              zip which includes your custom icons). So if you use this feature you might want to export a fresh backup.

                New weather widget! Give it a try, it can display both current weather in selected city and weather

                We got rid of a few internal libraries and adjusted compilation settings, so extension files now take
                less space. This should make loading extension slightly faster (around 10%).

              <li>New option 'Show animation on open'.</li>
